# tvsews

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of tvsews is to provide code and data for a manuscript (in
preparation) associated with a whole-lake fertilization experiment that
compared the performance of early warning statistics (EWS) in temporal
and spatial data.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cbuelo/tvsews")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# library(tvsews)
## basic example code
```

Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
